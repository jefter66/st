* st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
* Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
**  For emojis and special characteres (archlinux)
  Get the libxft-bgra from the AUR.
* Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell 
  sudo make clean install
#+END_SRC

* Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    tic -sx st.info
#+END_SRC

See the man page for additional details.
